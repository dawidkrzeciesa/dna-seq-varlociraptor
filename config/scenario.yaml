# This scenario is templated with YTE (https://yte-template-engine.github.io)
# and rendered for each group (see sample sheet).
# A variable `samples` is available, holding the dataframe of
# the sample sheet, filtered to those samples contained in the group to be rendered.
# For example, this can be used to pass arbitrary column values (like the purity below),
# to the sample definitions.
# Note that sample names here must correspond to the alias column in the sample sheet.
# In addition, a variable `group_annotation` is available, which holds the row of the group
# from the group annotation table (if specified in the config) as a pandas Series.
